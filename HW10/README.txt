MISC. COMMENTS TO GRADER:  
Optional, please be concise!

I ran into a a bug that made it so that none of the names would show up. When I put a
std::cout statement inside the constructor to print either inname(argument) or name(member variable),
nothing would show up. I double checked that my class connections were correct, I used the memory debugger but
got no memory errors, and asked on submitty but didn't get very far considering they can't see my code. I really 
have no idea what could be the problem. For the kite I knew that the diagonals should bisect perpendicularly and for a rhombus the diagonals
should bisect the angles, but I have no idea how to implement that.
